	 *For this task you will have to calculate and return the stamp duty of a property you have purchased.
	 *Stamp duty is a type of tax applied by the UK goverment when you purchase a property, this tax works in price brackets.
	 *i.e the same way income tax does.
	 *Up to £125,000 there is 0% tax.
	 *£125,000.001 - £250,000 there is 2% tax.
	 *£250,000.001 - £925,000 there is 5% tax.
	 *£925,000.001 - £1,500,000 there is 10% tax.
	 *£1,500,000.001+ there is 12% tax
	 *For example if you buy a house worth £295,000:
	 *0 % on the first £125,000 = £0
	 *2% on the next £125,000 = £2,500
	 *5% on £45,00 remaining = £2,250
	 *Total tax = £4,750
	 * @param propertyPrice The price of the property being bought
	 * @return A double for the total amount of tax.
